# Organism

An open source design kit for desktop apps extending Material Design.

The world doesn't need another design system. Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) language has all the elements for design teams to create better products. With a number of well supported UI frameworks available, it is also a smart choice for development teams.

Material Design has been driven largely by Google's consumer product development, especially Android. Naturally, most examples of Material Design focus on small touch screen devices and consumer apps.

Organism is an open source design kit created by a community of designers working with Material Design to create enterprise desktop applications.

Following the principles of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), Organism takes the *Atoms* and *Molecules* from Material Design and adds new *Organisms*; desktop app layouts, data visualizations and other design patterns proven in real applications.

The Organism design kit is available for [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and makes use of [Symbols](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/) and [Libraries](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/) to deliver reusable and extendable elements with optional overrides for color and branding.
